This is my **final week** of the cybersecurity upskilling journey with **Microsoft ADC and Cyber Shujaa**, specializing in **Cloud Security**, and it's been an incredibly rewarding experience.

Over the past few weeks, I’ve earned **27 Microsoft badges** and **6 trophies** from Microsoft Learn by completing hands-on labs and modules focused on real-world, in-demand security skills. Key areas where I’ve gained practical experience include:

- **Microsoft Entra**: Identity protection, governance, access management, and authentication  
- **Azure Security**: Security management, infrastructure protection, and Microsoft Defender XDR  
- **Microsoft Purview & Priva**: Data governance, compliance, security, and privacy solutions  
- **Microsoft Sentinel**: Threat detection, investigation, and response using SIEM capabilities  
- **Microsoft 365 Compliance**: Service Trust Portal, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and compliance solutions  

Through hands-on labs and scenario-based learning, I’ve built a solid foundation in **cloud security**, **identity and access management**, and **data protection**, preparing me to tackle modern cybersecurity challenges with confidence.

I also explored key security frameworks like **MITRE ATT&CK**, a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

This journey has been transformative, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to grow both technically and professionally.
